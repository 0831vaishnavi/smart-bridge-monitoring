# Smart Bridge Monitoring System

## Description
The Smart Bridge Monitoring System is an innovative solution designed to manage flood scenarios by automatically adjusting the height of a bridge. Using a combination of sensors, actuators, and Arduino, the system ensures safety and reliability during extreme weather conditions.

## Workflow
1. **System Design**  
   - Designed a mechanical system with adjustable bridge components.  
   - Integrated sensors to detect water levels and environmental conditions.

2. **Hardware Development**  
   - Used Arduino Uno to control actuators and sensors.  
   - Programmed the system to respond automatically to rising water levels.

3. **Testing and Deployment**  
   - Conducted simulations to test the system's reliability in various scenarios.  
   - Fine-tuned the system for optimal performance.

## Steps
1. Design and fabricate the bridge structure with adjustable height.
2. Connect sensors to monitor water levels and environmental conditions.
3. Program the Arduino Uno to control the actuators.
4. Test the system under simulated flood conditions.

## Outcome
A robust and efficient system capable of mitigating flood risks by dynamically adjusting the bridge height, enhancing safety in flood-prone areas.
